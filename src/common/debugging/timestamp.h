// Indicates whether or not to use a call to RDTSC (Read Time Stamp Counter)
// to calculate timestamp. The benefit of using this is that it is fast and
// accurate, returning actual clock ticks. The downside is that this does not
// work well with CPUs that use Speedstep technology to vary their clock speeds.
//
// Alternate Linux implementation uses gettimeofday. In rough tests, this can
// be between 20 and 600 times slower than using RDTSC. Also, there is a problem
// under 2.4 kernels where two consecutive calls to gettimeofday may actually
// return a result that goes backwards.
