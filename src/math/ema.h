/**
*	This class represents an exponentially weighted moving average.
*  (if no wights applied by number of samples, this is not stat's average but the stat itself that is accurate)
*
*  @details see http://www.forexabode.com/forex-school/technical-indicators/moving-averages/exponential-moving-average/
*  Current periods’ exponential moving average =  (Previous period's EMA * (1 - Exponent))+(Previous period’s closing price * Exponent)
*  Let’s assume the following to make an example:
*  You wish to calculate daily current EMA while using EMA of 22 periods
*  Let’s say today is 20th April
*  The closing price of April 19th was 135.80
*  EMA of April 19th was 132.60
*  So the exponent = 2 / (22+1) = = 0.08695
*  Hence using the above formula, the EMA of April 20th = (135.80 * 0.08695) + (132.80) * (1 - 0.08695) = 135.41
*
*	The nth sample (given via the sample() method) updates the Current periods’ exponential moving average ()
*	according to: avg(n) = (1 - bias) * sample( n-1 ) + bias * avg( n - 1 )
*
*	This class is entirely inlined.
